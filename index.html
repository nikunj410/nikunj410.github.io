<p>I am a dispersal biogeographer. Broadly, I take a demographic perspective to study the role of dispersal in shaping ecological and evolutionary patterns, using mathematical and Bayesian models. My work explores how biodiversity is maintained at population margins using theoretical ideas from network science, quantitative genetics, coalescent theory, matrix population models, and spread phenomenon.

<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://mhooten.github.io/"><span>Mevin Hooten's lab</span></a> at the <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu/"><span>Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</span></a>, University of Texas at Austin. Before that, I completed my	Ph.D. with <a href="https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/keittlab/home"><span>Timothy Keitt</span></a> at the <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program"><span>Department of Integrative Biology</span></a>, University of Texas at Austin. I received my MSc in <a href="https://eeb.yale.edu/"><span>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</span></a> from Yale	University. I received my <a href="https://ug.iisc.ac.in/"><span>undergraduate degree</span></a> in Physics and Environmental Sciences from the Indian Institute of Science, where I did my senior thesis with <a href="https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/"><span>Vishwesha Guttal</span></a>. </span></p>
