### 2023

*   I successfully defended my PhD.
*   I was awarded the Trailblazer Ecology Publication award by the Student Section, Ecological Society of America.
*   I presented my work on spatial sorting at the biannual [ASN conference](https://asnasilomar2023.org/) at Asilomar and Evolution.

<br>

### 2022

*   What limits species ranges? Check out our new [paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/720420?journalCode=an) in the American Naturalist.
*   I presented my work on spatial sorting at the Center for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
*   I was awarded C.P. “Pete” Oliver fellowship by UT Austin to conduct my research on soapberry bugs.
*   I got into ecology through a series of fortunate events. As a Stengl-Wyer graduate fellow, I [write](https://biodiversity.utexas.edu/news/entry/meet-stengl-wyer-fellow-nikunj-goel) about how I got here and where I plan to go next.
*   I was awarded [Graduate Continuing Fellowship](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/funding/fellowships/grad-school/continuing) by UT Austin for 2022-23.
*   Are you an empiricist wanting to understand and do ecology theory? We [published](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717206) a step-by-step guide on how you can get started.

<br>

### 2021

*   I will be joining the [ASN Graduate Student Council](https://asngrads.com/) as a student representative.
*   How to build the evolutionary theory of spatial sorting? Check out the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.20.461092v1) of my paper, where I outline my views.
*   Our paper on the resilience of savanna and forest biomes received the [Outstanding Paper Award](https://www.esa.org/theory/awards/past-outstanding-paper-award-recipients/) from the Theory Section at ESA.
*   I was awarded the [Stengl-Wyer graduate fellowship](https://cns.utexas.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1544:stengl-wyer-graduate-fellowships&catid=256) by the College of Natural Sciences, UT Austin for 2021-22.
*   I was awarded the summer fellowship by the College of Natural Sciences, UT Austin.
*   Our [paper](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3177) on savanna-forest dynamics in Madagascar was awarded the [Robert P McIntosh award](https://www.esa.org/vegetation/robert-p-mcintosh-award/) by the Vegetation Section, ESA.
*   I am officially a Ph.D. candidate.
*   I got vaccinated.
*   I will be presenting my work on source-sink dynamics at the American Society of Naturalists (virtually). ​

<br>

### 2020 (Finally it's over)

*   We describe how source-sink dynamics maintain range limits in a new paper posted on [bioRxiv.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.05.413153v1)
*   Our contribution is in a special feature out in [Neobiota.](https://neobiota.pensoft.net/article/53213/)
*   Our paper on the range pinning of the savanna-forest boundary in Madagascar is out in [Ecology.](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3177)
*   This fall, I am teaching Evolution (my first time) with Nancy Moran and Thomas Juenger.
*   This summer, I presented at virtual ESA and eSMB on how source-sink dynamics regulate geographical limits.
*   I was awarded the summer fellowship from the College of Natural Sciences, UT Austin.
*   My first first-author paper from masters got [published](https://www.amnat.org/an/newpapers/May-Goel.html) in The American Naturalist.
*   This spring, I will assist Lindsey Smith in teaching Biostatistics.
