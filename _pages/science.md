      We face an invasion crisis. Rapid globalization of trade and commerce has displaced many species beyond their native realm, resulting in massive monetary and biodiversity losses. Therefore, understanding why drivers of the establishment and spread of invasive species is critical to maintaining ecosystem health.

      To this end, I am exploring the interplay between population demography and human transportation networks to study two broad questions: how do species spread via human dispersal pathways, and why do some species become more invasive than others? Understanding these questions will advance ecology theory and yield insights to control invader populations and mitigate their adverse effects.

Organisms are continuously changing their position by moving or dispersing their propagules. This ubiquitous feature of life is responsible for generating a wide range of ecological and evolutionary patterns at population margins, including the evolution of increased dispersal rates, the spread of invasive species, and mismatched geographical and niche limits. My research aims to elucidate how dispersal generates these biogeographical patterns across scales in unison with other biological processes.

My research work combines both theoretical and statistical approaches. I use theory to generate empirically testable insights that allow us to unify concepts across seemingly disparate systems that are otherwise challenging. Naturally, my research relies on long walks and pen and paper. Although my research has a strong theoretical bend, I collaborate with empiricists to [test theoretical predictions.](https://www.cell.com/trends/cell-biology/fulltext/S0962-8924(15)00194-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0962892415001944%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)
